Error handling with try and catch: Managing errors in asynchronous code
5. Implementing the Tasks
Task 1: Handling API responses with promises
Task 2: Using uploadPhoto and createUser functions to manage promises
6. Testing and Linting
Running Jest tests: Ensuring your code is correct
Using ESLint: Keeping your code clean and error-free
